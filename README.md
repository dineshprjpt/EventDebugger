This application works mostly on the rooted device. It reads the device's touch I/O files and present the events in readable format.

This is JNI based application. which developed to study the touch event patterns of android device.
application works with rooted device. it reads underline touch IO files where android system writes touch events.
here we are putting the thread to observe the events and read it and passing to the application to display.

This help us to understand the touch event patterns from different OEMs and which will be useful to develop touch based auto injector.
